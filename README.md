 <li>For pictures labeled ”a” and ”d” inn the exercise titled ”Intersection Of Three Planes” done in lecture, write down a 3×3 system (that is, a system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns) that corresponds to that picture. Explain why you think your system is valid. In other words, use sentences, math notations and calculations, etc. (whatever is necessary), to show that the picture representing the system you wrote down indeed looks like the given picture.</li>

 <li>Complete the following sentences about linear systems of equations by either choosing the correct words or filling in the blanks. Answer the question in part (c) too.

  <ul>

   <li>(<em>Strang </em><em>1.2 #14</em>) For two linear equations in three unknowns <em>x,y,z</em>, the row picture will show (2 or 3) (lines or planes) in (two or three)-dimensional space. The column picture is in (two or three)dimensional space. The solutions normally lie on a.</li>

   <li>(<em>Strang </em><em>1.2 #15</em>) For four linear equations in two unkwons <em>x </em>and <em>y</em>, the row picture shows four in -dimensional space.
